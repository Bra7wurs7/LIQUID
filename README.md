Liquid aims to be 
- A universal user interface for any sort of public web api.
- A "web operating system", "semiautonomous" if you will, truly assisting the user via an LLM powered agent that can make the same inputs and take the same actions as the user.
  - To realize this, every GUI function also needs a TUI counterpart that a Language Model can somehow interface with. (ML- & LLM-Assisted parsing of LLM or USER written plaintext/code)
- The GUI and TUI automatically generate from the API Documentation and public information.
  - Until that is possible, uis are easily user-configurable
 

Known bugs:
- Can not delete vault/folder/project
